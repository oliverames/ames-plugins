A single repo that ships Oliver Ames' personal plugin catalog to two AI coding agents at once: **Claude Code** (official, supported) and **Codex** (experimental). The same plugin tree carries both manifest formats side by side, so one `git push` updates both hosts.

## Why this exists

Running two agents without duplicating content is a real problem. Claude Code and Codex both adopted a plugin/skill model in early 2026, but they publish incompatible marketplace manifests at different paths (`.claude-plugin/` vs `.agents/plugins/`) and different schemas. Most marketplaces ship only one. That forces users to either pick an agent or maintain parallel forks.

ames-claude takes the additive route. One tree, two manifest namespaces, identical skill and MCP content underneath. Skills are portable by spec (the SKILL.md format is shared across hosts per Anthropic's Agent Skills and OpenAI's Codex Skills). Only the plugin and marketplace manifests differ, and both sit in the same repo. The cost is a small amount of duplicated JSON; the benefit is a single source of truth for an otherwise split ecosystem.

**Claude Code support is production.** **Codex support is experimental**, since Codex's plugin marketplace launched March 2026 and its CLI surface is still stabilizing.

## Quick start

### Claude Code (official, supported)

**Declarative install.** Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "ames-claude": {
      "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "oliverames/ames-claude" },
      "autoUpdate": true
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "ames-standalone-skills@ames-claude": true,
    "ames-preferred-mcps@ames-claude": true,
    "ames-ynab@ames-claude": true,
    "ames-lytho@ames-claude": true,
    "ames-community-skills@ames-claude": true,
    "build-ios-apps-codex@ames-claude": true,
    "build-macos-apps-codex@ames-claude": true
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Code. The marketplace registers, plugins install, and `autoUpdate` keeps them current on each launch.

**Interactive install.** Or run:

```
/plugin marketplace add oliverames/ames-claude
/plugin install ames-standalone-skills@ames-claude
/plugin install ames-preferred-mcps@ames-claude
/plugin install ames-ynab@ames-claude
/plugin install ames-lytho@ames-claude
/plugin install ames-community-skills@ames-claude
/plugin install build-ios-apps-codex@ames-claude
/plugin install build-macos-apps-codex@ames-claude
```

### Codex (experimental)

```
codex marketplace add https://github.com/oliverames/ames-claude
```

Then install plugins through Codex's plugin UI or CLI. `build-ios-apps-codex` and `build-macos-apps-codex` are intentionally absent from the Codex side (see below).

> **Heads-up:** Codex's marketplace commands are still stabilizing. Verify exact syntax with `codex --help` before scripting. File an issue if any Codex manifest in this repo falls out of spec.

## Plugins

Seven plugins ship in this marketplace:

| Plugin | Hosts | Version | Summary |
|--------|-------|---------|---------|
| [`ames-standalone-skills`](plugins/ames-standalone-skills/) | Claude + Codex | 3.5.0 | Oliver's original skill pack (28 skills) |
| [`ames-preferred-mcps`](plugins/ames-preferred-mcps/) | Claude + Codex | 2.0.0 | 13 curated third-party MCP servers |
| [`ames-ynab`](plugins/ames-ynab/) | Claude + Codex | 2.0.0 | Custom YNAB MCP connector |
| [`ames-lytho`](plugins/ames-lytho/) | Claude + Codex | 1.0.0 | Custom Lytho Workflow MCP connector |
| [`ames-community-skills`](plugins/ames-community-skills/) | Claude + Codex | 2.0.0 | Third-party skills without upstream marketplaces |
| [`build-ios-apps-codex`](plugins/build-ios-apps-codex/) | **Claude only** | 1.0.0 | 6 iOS dev skills converted from OpenAI's Codex plugin |
| [`build-macos-apps-codex`](plugins/build-macos-apps-codex/) | **Claude only** | 1.0.0 | 11 macOS dev skills + 3 commands converted from OpenAI's Codex plugin |

### `ames-standalone-skills`

Oliver's original Claude Code skills covering writing, development, automation, finance, and Apple platform work. 28 skills organized by theme (see [Skills catalog](#skills-catalog)).

### `ames-preferred-mcps`

A single plugin that activates 13 curated third-party MCP servers:

| MCP | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `apple-docs` | Apple Developer documentation search and WWDC lookup |
| `apple-notifier` | Native macOS notifications, speech, screen capture |
| `drafts` | Drafts.app integration for note capture |
| `excel` | Excel workbook manipulation |
| `google-workspace` | Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Tasks, Meet |
| `iMCP` | Apple event bridge (calendars, reminders) |
| `macos-automator` | AppleScript and JXA via osascript |
| `markitdown` | Convert files to Markdown |
| `pandoc` | Universal document conversion |
| `peekaboo` | macOS UI automation and screen capture |
| `SimGenie` | iOS Simulator helpers |
| `sosumi` | Apple documentation fetcher |
| `XcodeBuildMCP` | Xcode build/run/test for simulators and devices |

Some servers depend on locally installed apps or additional credentials.

### `ames-ynab`

Activates `ynab-mcp-server` (published as `@oliverames/ynab-mcp-server` on npm) for read and write access to YNAB budgets, transactions, categories, scheduled transactions, and payees.

**Required env:** `YNAB_API_TOKEN`

### `ames-lytho`

Activates `lytho-mcp-server` (published as `@oliverames/lytho-mcp-server` on npm) for read and write access to Lytho work requests, tasks, proofs, projects, campaigns, and preferences through the Lytho Open API.

**Required env:** `LYTHO_CLIENT_ID`, `LYTHO_CLIENT_SECRET`, `LYTHO_TOKEN_URL`

### `ames-community-skills`

A wrapper for third-party skills that ship as bare `SKILL.md` files with no upstream marketplace of their own. Currently one skill:

- [`humanizer`](plugins/ames-community-skills/skills/humanizer/) — Remove signs of AI-generated writing from text. Originally by [blader](https://github.com/blader/humanizer).

When an upstream author publishes their own marketplace (as [twostraws](https://github.com/twostraws/SwiftUI-Agent-Skill) did with SwiftUI Pro), that upstream is preferred and the skill leaves this plugin.

### `build-ios-apps-codex`

Claude Code only. 6 iOS development skills converted from OpenAI's [`build-ios-apps`](https://github.com/openai/plugins/tree/main/plugins/build-ios-apps) Codex plugin (MIT): `ios-app-intents`, `ios-debugger-agent`, `swiftui-liquid-glass`, `swiftui-performance-audit`, `swiftui-ui-patterns`, `swiftui-view-refactor`. Each lives at [`plugins/build-ios-apps-codex/skills/<name>/`](plugins/build-ios-apps-codex/skills/). Run [`./plugins/build-ios-apps-codex/update.sh`](plugins/build-ios-apps-codex/update.sh) to resync from the local Codex plugin cache.

### `build-macos-apps-codex`

Claude Code only. 11 macOS development skills plus 3 commands converted from OpenAI's [`build-macos-apps`](https://github.com/openai/plugins/tree/main/plugins/build-macos-apps) Codex plugin (MIT): `appkit-interop`, `build-run-debug`, `liquid-glass`, `packaging-notarization`, `signing-entitlements`, `swiftpm-macos`, `swiftui-patterns`, `telemetry`, `test-triage`, `view-refactor`, `window-management`. Commands: `build-and-run-macos-app`, `fix-codesign-error`, `test-macos-app`. Run [`./plugins/build-macos-apps-codex/update.sh`](plugins/build-macos-apps-codex/update.sh) to resync from the local Codex plugin cache.

Both plugins originated in [openai/plugins](https://github.com/openai/plugins) and were adapted for Claude Code. They are omitted from the Codex marketplace manifest by design, since installing them in Codex would re-import already-diverged skills.

## MCP servers catalog

15 MCP servers across three plugins:

| Plugin | Server | Package |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `ames-lytho` | `lytho-mcp-server` | [`@oliverames/lytho-mcp-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oliverames/lytho-mcp-server) |
| `ames-ynab` | `ynab-mcp-server` | [`@oliverames/ynab-mcp-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oliverames/ynab-mcp-server) |
| `ames-preferred-mcps` | 13 third-party servers | See [plugin table](#ames-preferred-mcps) above |

## Architecture

The repo carries two parallel manifest namespaces under a shared plugin tree:

```
ames-claude/
├── .claude-plugin/marketplace.json        # Claude Code marketplace (authoritative)
├── .agents/plugins/marketplace.json       # Codex marketplace (experimental)
└── plugins/
    └── <plugin-name>/
        ├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json     # Claude Code plugin manifest
        ├── .codex-plugin/plugin.json      # Codex plugin manifest (if applicable)
        ├── .mcp.json                      # MCP server config (portable across hosts)
        └── skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md   # Skill files (portable across hosts)
```

| Host | Marketplace manifest | Per-plugin manifest | Plugins |
|------|----------------------|---------------------|---------|
| Claude Code | `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` | `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | 7 |
| Codex (experimental) | `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` | `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` | 5 (excludes `build-ios-apps-codex`, `build-macos-apps-codex`) |

### What crosses the boundary

- **Skill content** (`SKILL.md` and bundled resources) is portable by spec
- **MCP configs** (`.mcp.json`) use the same shape on both hosts
- **Plugin content** structurally matches on both sides

### What does not

- **Plugin and marketplace manifests** differ in location and schema; they live side by side in the same repo
- **`build-ios-apps-codex` and `build-macos-apps-codex`** are Claude Code only by design (converted-from-Codex skills can't round-trip cleanly, since they already exist upstream in `openai/plugins`)
- **Third-party marketplaces that publish only one manifest format** can't be rewrapped by ames-claude. Install those from upstream wherever the author supports

## Configuration

Per-plugin environment requirements:

| Plugin | Variable | Required | Purpose |
|--------|----------|----------|---------|
| `ames-ynab` | `YNAB_API_TOKEN` | Yes | YNAB Personal Access Token |
| `ames-lytho` | `LYTHO_CLIENT_ID` | Yes | Lytho OAuth client ID |
| `ames-lytho` | `LYTHO_CLIENT_SECRET` | Yes | Lytho OAuth client secret |
| `ames-lytho` | `LYTHO_TOKEN_URL` | Yes | Lytho OAuth token endpoint |
| `ames-preferred-mcps` | varies | varies | Some servers require their own credentials or apps |

Credentials are never stored in the repo. MCPs reference environment variables at runtime, with secrets resolved from the user's local configuration.

## Versioning

Each plugin's version lives in three places that must stay in sync:

1. `plugins/<name>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — Claude-side authoritative
2. `plugins/<name>/.codex-plugin/plugin.json` — Codex mirror (must match 1)
3. Root `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — per-plugin `version` (must match 1)

The marketplace itself has a separate version at `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`'s top-level `metadata.version`, currently `3.4.0`.

Workflow scripts at the repo root (`sync`, `bump-and-sync`) help keep these aligned after content changes. Always run one of those before committing version-bearing changes.

## Development

### Adding a new skill

1. Create `plugins/ames-standalone-skills/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`)
2. Add supporting files (references, scripts) in subdirectories as needed
3. Run `bump-and-sync` from the repo root
4. Commit and push; Claude Code users with `autoUpdate` pick it up on next launch

### Adding a new plugin

1. Create `plugins/<plugin-name>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` with `name`, `version`, `description`, `author`
2. For dual-host support, also create `plugins/<plugin-name>/.codex-plugin/plugin.json` mirroring the Claude manifest with Codex-specific `interface` and `category` fields
3. Add the plugin entry to both `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`
4. Add content (skills, commands, MCPs) at the plugin root per spec
5. Run `bump-and-sync` and commit

## My Claude Code configuration

A complete snapshot of `~/.claude/settings.json`, documented here so this repo doubles as a rebuilding reference. **Kept in sync by the `wrap-up` skill**: any session that changes `~/.claude/settings.json` or installs or removes a plugin also updates the tables below and commits the result. If this machine died tomorrow, these tables plus a fresh `~/.claude/settings.json` would reconstruct the environment.

### Environment variables

Defined in `env` block of `~/.claude/settings.json` and at session launch. `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` is intentionally omitted from this record.

**Claude Code runtime:**

| Variable | Value | Why |
|----------|-------|-----|
| `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` | `1` | Opt into experimental agent teams feature for multi-agent workflows |
| `ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH` | `1` | Enable deferred-tool search via the `ToolSearch` tool, keeping the initial tool list short |
| `CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE` | `85` | Auto-compact context at 85% of window rather than the default 95%, for more headroom before compression |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_NO_FLICKER` | `1` | Suppress terminal redraw flicker during streaming output |
| `BASH_MAX_OUTPUT_LENGTH` | `200000` | Raise the Bash output truncation limit to 200KB for long-running commands (tests, builds) |

**Plugin credentials (set in shell, not in settings.json):**

| Variable | Used by | Source |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `YNAB_API_TOKEN` | `ames-ynab` | YNAB Personal Access Token, create at https://app.ynab.com/settings/developer |
| `LYTHO_CLIENT_ID` | `ames-lytho` | Lytho OAuth client ID |
| `LYTHO_CLIENT_SECRET` | `ames-lytho` | Lytho OAuth client secret |
| `LYTHO_TOKEN_URL` | `ames-lytho` | Lytho OAuth token endpoint |

Other plugin-specific credentials (for servers in `ames-preferred-mcps` and some third-party plugins) are resolved at runtime through local configuration rather than stored in the repo.

### Permissions

`permissions.defaultMode` is `auto` (auto-allow tools on the allowlist without prompting). The allowlist covers core file I/O, search, language tooling, skills, agents, and teamwork primitives so those never interrupt flow:

`Read`, `Edit`, `Write`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `NotebookEdit`, `TaskCreate`, `TaskUpdate`, `TaskList`, `TaskGet`, `TaskStop`, `LSP`, `Agent`, `Skill`, `ToolSearch`, `ListMcpResourcesTool`, `ReadMcpResourceTool`, `EnterWorktree`, `TeamCreate`, `TeamDelete`, `SendMessage`

`deny` is empty. Tools outside the allowlist still require explicit approval. Two additional flags suppress specific prompts: `skipAutoPermissionPrompt: true` (no repeated prompts for the same tool) and `skipDangerousModePermissionPrompt: true` (no warning when entering dangerous mode).

### Hooks

Two `PostToolUse` hooks, both in `hooks.PostToolUse`:

| Matcher | Command | Effect |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `Bash` | Python one-liner that checks if the bash command contained `git commit`, and if so prints `✅ Committed` and the latest commit summary | Lightweight confirmation that a commit actually landed, useful during multi-commit sessions |
| `Edit\|Write` | `bash ~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Developer/Scripts/validate-skill` | Runs the `validate-skill` shell script after any file edit or write, to catch skill authoring errors (malformed frontmatter, broken references) at write time |

### Status line

`statusLine.command` runs `bash ~/.claude/statusline-command.sh`, which renders a custom status line.

### UI and agent behavior

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `outputStyle` | `Explanatory` | Default to the explanatory style, which surfaces educational insights alongside changes. Useful when the point of a session is learning as much as shipping |
| `alwaysThinkingEnabled` | `true` | Extended thinking on for every turn, not just complex ones. Opus 4.7 uses the thinking budget adaptively |
| `effortLevel` | `xhigh` | Maximum effort tier; Claude plans harder and verifies more before acting |
| `autoDreamEnabled` | `true` | Background reflection between turns (experimental) |
| `teammateMode` | `auto` | Auto-spawn teammate agents when the workflow obviously benefits from parallelism |
| `viewMode` | `focus` | Focused UI mode: hide non-essential chrome |
| `voiceEnabled` | `true` | Voice I/O on for spoken prompts and replies |
| `remoteControlAtStartup` | `true` | Accept remote-control connections from other clients at launch |

### Miscellaneous

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `cleanupPeriodDays` | `45` | Keep conversation history for 45 days instead of the default, since some projects span weeks |
| `autoUpdatesChannel` | `latest` | Track the bleeding-edge Claude Code release channel |
| `feedbackSurveyRate` | `0` | Disable in-product feedback surveys |
| `enableAllProjectMcpServers` | `true` | Project-level MCP servers from `.mcp.json` load automatically without per-project opt-in |

### Keeping this section current

The `wrap-up` skill runs a config-drift check at end of session. If any of these change during a session, the wrap-up flow updates this section and commits the change:

- New plugin enabled or disabled in `~/.claude/settings.json`
- New marketplace added to `extraKnownMarketplaces`
- New env variable added to `env`
- Any top-level settings value changes
- Any hook added, removed, or modified
